For short hair, you'll want to use a curling iron with a smaller barrel size, typically between ¾ inch and 1 inch. This will help you to create tighter, more defined curls that will hold their shape throughout the day.</p><p>You'll also want to consider the material of the curling iron. Ceramic and tourmaline are both great options for short hair, as they provide even heat distribution and help to eliminate frizz. Titanium curling irons are also a good choice, as they heat up quickly and can help to create smooth, shiny curls.</p><p>Finally, pay attention to the temperature settings of the curling iron. For short hair, you'll want to use a lower temperature setting to prevent damage and breakage. Look for a curling iron that allows you to adjust the temperature, so you can find the perfect setting for your hair type.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Curling Short Hair</h2><p>Now that you've chosen the right curling iron for your short hair, it's time to get started.
