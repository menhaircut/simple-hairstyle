This step ensures that every strand of hair gets adequately coated with product.</li><li><strong>Apply leave-in conditioner:</strong> Apply a leave-in conditioner to each section of your hair, starting from the ends and working your way up to the roots. Be sure to apply the product in a downward motion to reduce frizz and encourage curl formation.</li><li><strong>Apply curl cream or gel:</strong> Apply a curl cream or gel to each section of your hair, starting from the ends and working your way up to the roots. Be sure to apply the product in a downward motion to reduce frizz and encourage curl formation.</li><li><strong>Scrunch your hair:</strong> Scrunch your hair to encourage curl formation and reduce excess water and product. Use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to scrunch your hair gently.</li><li><strong>Diffuse your hair:</strong> Use a diffuser to dry your curls gently.
