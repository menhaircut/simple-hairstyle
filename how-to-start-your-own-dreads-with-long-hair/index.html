Starting your own dreads with long hair is an easy process that just requires a bit of patience and the right tools. In this article, we'll show you how to start your own dreads with long hair in relaxed English language, and provide tips and advice for maintaining them. </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ul><li> How to Prepare Your Hair </li><li> How to Section Your Hair </li><li> How to Backcomb Your Hair </li><li> How to Twist and Rip </li><li> How to Maintain Your Dreads </li><li> Tips for Starting Your Own Dreads with Long Hair </li><li> Frequently Asked Questions </li><li> Conclusion </li></ul><h2> How to Prepare Your Hair </h2><p> Before you start your dreads, it's important to prepare your hair properly. If you have long hair, you'll want to make sure it's clean and free of any tangles. Start by washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup. Then, condition your hair to make it easier to work with. </p><p> Once your hair is clean and conditioned, let it air dry or use a blow dryer on low heat. Avoid using any styling products or combs at this point, as you want your hair to be as natural as possible. </p><h2> How to Section Your Hair </h2><p> The next step is to section your hair. Use a rat-tail comb to create even sections of hair that are about the size of your dreadlocks. You can create as many sections as you like, but keep in mind that the more sections you have, the thinner your dreads will be. </p><p> Once you've sectioned your hair, use rubber bands or hair ties to keep each section separate. This will make it easier to work with each section individually. </p><h2> How to Backcomb Your Hair </h2><p> Backcombing is a popular method for starting dreadlocks, and it's easy to do at home. Start by taking one section of hair and backcombing it with a fine-toothed comb. Hold the section of hair taut with one hand and comb it with the other, starting about an inch from the roots and working your way down to the ends. </p><p> Repeat this process until the entire section of hair is backcombed. Then, use a dreadlock crochet hook to pull the hair back through itself, creating a knot at the base of the dread. </p><h2> How to Twist and Rip </h2><p> Another popular method for starting dreadlocks is twist and rip. This method involves twisting a section of hair and then ripping it apart in the opposite direction. This creates a roughed-up texture that will help the hair lock together. </p><p> To twist and rip, take one section of hair and twist it tightly from root to tip. Then, hold the bottom of the twist with one hand and use the other hand to rip the twist apart, starting from the bottom and working your way up to the roots. </p><h2> How to Maintain Your Dreads </h2><p> Once you've started your dreads, it's important to maintain them properly to keep them looking their best. This involves regular washing, conditioning, and separating. </p><p> To wash your dreads, use a residue-free shampoo and work it into your scalp. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing your dreads, as this can cause them to unravel. Rinse thoroughly and then use a residue-free conditioner on the lengths of your dreads. </p><p> To separate your dreads, use your fingers to gently pull apart any sections that are starting to merge together. This will help maintain the shape and size of your dreads. </p><h2> Tips for Starting Your Own Dreads with Long Hair </h2><ul><li> Be patient – it can take several months for your dreads to fully mature </li><li> Avoid using wax or other products that can leave residue in your hair </li><li> Use a satin or silk pillowcase to prevent your dreads from getting caught on cotton </li><li> Consider using a crochet hook to tighten your dreads as they mature </li></ul><h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2><h3> How long does it take to start dreadlocks? </h3><p> It can take several months for your dreads to fully mature, but the process of starting them can be done in a day or two. </p><h3> Can I start dreadlocks with relaxed hair? </h3><p> Yes, you can start dreadlocks with relaxed hair. However, keep in mind that relaxed hair is more fragile and may require extra care to prevent breakage. </p><h3> Can I wash my hair with dreads? </h3><p> Yes, you can and should wash your hair with dreads. Use a residue-free shampoo and conditioner and avoid rubbing or scrubbing your dreads. </p><h2> Conclusion </h2><p> Starting your own dreads with long hair is an easy process that just requires a bit of patience and the right tools. Whether you choose to backcomb or twist and rip, the key to maintaining healthy dreads is to wash and separate them regularly. With a little bit of care and attention, you can enjoy beautiful, natural-looking dreadlocks that will last for years to come. </p></article>
