It can be a distressing experience, especially since hair is often considered a symbol of youth and vitality. Losing hair at such a young age can be a source of embarrassment and self-consciousness, leading to a loss of self-esteem and confidence.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you are experiencing hair loss at 14, it is important to take action as soon as possible to prevent further hair loss and promote hair growth. Here are some steps you can take:</p><h3>1. Consult a Doctor</h3><p>The first step is to visit a doctor or dermatologist who specializes in hair loss.

Avoid using them frequently or use them on a low heat setting.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair from the Sun</h3><p>The sun can damage your hair and lead to hair loss. Wear a hat or use a hair product with SPF to protect your hair from the sun's harmful rays.</p><p>In conclusion, hair loss at 14 can be a distressing experience, but it is not uncommon.
