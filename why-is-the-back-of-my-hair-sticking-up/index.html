Do you find yourself constantly smoothing down the back of your hair? If so, you're not alone. Many people struggle with hair that sticks up in the back, and it can be frustrating to deal with. But don't worry, we've got you covered. In this article, we'll explore the reasons why the back of your hair might be sticking up and provide tips and tricks to help you tame those flyaways.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The back of the hair sticking up is a common issue among people with different hair types, lengths and textures. It can be caused by a variety of factors, from dryness and breakage to static and humidity. Whatever the reason, it can be challenging to deal with, especially if you're trying to achieve a sleek, polished look. Fortunately, there are several ways to address this issue and get your hair looking smooth and flyaway-free.</p><h2>How to Tame Flyaway Hair</h2><p>If you're dealing with hair that sticks up in the back, there are a few things you can do to tame those flyaways. Here are some tips to try:</p><h3>1. Use a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Dryness is a common cause of flyaway hair. If your hair is dry and brittle, it's more likely to stick up and be difficult to manage. Using a leave-in conditioner can help add moisture and hydration to your hair, making it smoother and more manageable. Apply a small amount of leave-in conditioner to the back of your hair, focusing on the ends, and then comb it through gently.</p><h3>2. Apply Hair Oil</h3><p>Hair oils are a great way to add shine and smoothness to your hair. They can also help control frizz and flyaways. Apply a small amount of hair oil to the back of your hair, focusing on the ends, and then comb it through gently. Avoid applying too much, as this can make your hair look greasy.</p><h3>3. Use a Smoothing Cream</h3><p>If you're dealing with particularly stubborn flyaways, a smoothing cream can help. Apply a small amount of smoothing cream to the back of your hair, focusing on the areas where your hair tends to stick up. Then, use a comb or your fingers to smooth the hair down.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Taming Flyaway Hair</h2><p>1. Start by washing and conditioning your hair as usual. Make sure to rinse your hair thoroughly, as any leftover product can contribute to flyaways.</p><p>2.

This will help prevent damage and breakage, which can contribute to flyaway hair.</p><h2>Tips for Preventing Flyaway Hair</h2><p>Prevention is key when it comes to flyaway hair. Here are some tips to help prevent your hair from sticking up in the first place:</p><h3>1. Use a Humidifier</h3><p>Dry air can contribute to flyaway hair, especially in the winter months. Using a humidifier can help add moisture to the air, which can in turn help keep your hair hydrated and less prone to flyaways.</p><h3>2. Avoid Over-Styling Your Hair</h3><p>Using heat styling tools and harsh chemicals can damage your hair and make it more prone to flyaways. Try to avoid over-styling your hair and opt for more natural hairstyles instead.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair While Sleeping</h3><p>Sleeping on a cotton pillowcase can cause friction and breakage, which can contribute to flyaway hair. Try sleeping on a silk or satin pillowcase instead, and consider wrapping your hair in a silk scarf or bonnet to protect it while you sleep.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q: Why is the back of my hair sticking up?</h3><p>A: There are several reasons why the back of your hair might be sticking up, including dryness, breakage, static, and humidity.</p><h3>Q: Can I use hairspray to tame flyaway hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, hairspray can help tame flyaway hair.

Here are some tips to help keep your hair healthy and flyaway-free:</p><h3>1. Avoid Using Harsh Chemicals</h3><p>Harsh chemicals can damage your hair and make it more prone to flyaways. Try to avoid using chemical treatments like relaxers, and opt for more natural hair care products instead.</p><h3>2. Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Regular trims can help prevent split ends and breakage, which can contribute to flyaway hair. Aim to get a trim every 6-8 weeks.</p><h3>3. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb</h3><p>Using a wide-tooth comb can help prevent breakage and damage to your hair. Avoid using a brush, as this can cause friction and make your hair more prone to flyaways.</p><p>In conclusion, dealing with flyaway hair can be frustrating, but there are several ways to tame those flyaways and get your hair looking smooth and polished.
