Get regular haircuts</h3><p>Regular haircuts can help keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends, which can make your hair look dull and lifeless. Even if you're trying to grow your hair out, it's important to get regular trims to keep your hair looking its best.</p><h3>3. Protect your hair from heat damage</h3><p>Heat damage can cause your hair to look dry, frizzy, and damaged.
