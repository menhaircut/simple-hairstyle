One of the main culprits is stress. The pandemic has caused a lot of stress and anxiety, which can lead to hair loss. Stress causes the hair follicles to enter the resting phase, which leads to hair fall.</p><p>Another reason for hair loss during COVID-19 is changes in lifestyle.

They can diagnose the cause of your hair loss and recommend the best treatment options.</p><p>Treatment options for hair loss during COVID-19 include medication, hair transplants, and low-level laser therapy. Minoxidil is a medication that is commonly used to treat hair loss. It is applied to the scalp and can help promote hair growth.</p><p>Hair transplants involve taking hair follicles from one part of the scalp and transplanting them to the affected area. This is a surgical procedure that should only be performed by a qualified professional.</p><p>Low-level laser therapy is a non-invasive treatment option that uses lasers to stimulate hair growth. It is painless and can be done at home using a laser comb or helmet.</p><h2 id="haircare">Hair Care Tips During COVID-19</h2><p>During COVID-19, it is important to take care of your hair to prevent hair loss.
