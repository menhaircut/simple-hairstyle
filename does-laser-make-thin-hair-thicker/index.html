Laser therapy can be used to treat various forms of hair loss, including androgenetic alopecia, which is the most common cause of hair loss in both men and women.</p><p>Many studies have shown that laser therapy can be effective in treating hair loss. In one study, participants who used a laser comb for 26 weeks saw a significant increase in hair density and thickness.
