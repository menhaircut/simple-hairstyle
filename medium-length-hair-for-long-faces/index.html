If you have a long face shape, finding the right haircut can be a challenge. You don't want to make your face look even longer, but you also don't want to hide your beautiful features. That's where medium length hair comes in – it's the perfect balance between long and short hair. In this article, we'll cover everything you need to know about medium length hair for long faces, including how to style it, tips for maintaining it, and more.</p><h2>What is a Long Face Shape?</h2><p>Before we dive into the world of medium length hair, let's first define what a long face shape is. A long face is characterized by a high forehead, a narrow jawline, and cheekbones that are not very prominent. If you have a long face, you may also have a prominent chin and a straight nose. Some famous examples of people with long face shapes include Sarah Jessica Parker, Liv Tyler, and Gisele Bundchen.</p><h2>How to Determine the Right Length for Your Face Shape</h2><p>When it comes to choosing a medium length haircut, it's important to consider your face shape. The goal is to find a length that balances out your features and doesn't make your face look even longer. A good rule of thumb is to aim for a length that falls somewhere between your chin and your shoulders. This length will help to create the illusion of width and balance out your face shape.</p><h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Styling Medium Length Hair for Long Faces</h3><p>Now that you know the basics of choosing the right length for your face shape, let's move on to styling. Here's a step-by-step guide to styling medium length hair for long faces:</p><p><strong>1. Start with clean, towel-dried hair.</strong> Before you start styling, make sure your hair is clean and free of any product buildup. Towel dry your hair until it's just slightly damp.</p><p><strong>2. Apply a heat protectant.</strong> If you plan on using heat styling tools, it's important to apply a heat protectant to your hair first. This will help to prevent damage and keep your hair looking healthy.</p><p><strong>3. Blow dry your hair.</strong> Use a round brush and a blow dryer to give your hair volume and shape. Start at the roots and work your way down to the ends.</p><p><strong>4. Curl your hair.</strong> Using a curling iron or a wand, curl your hair away from your face. This will help to create volume and movement.</p><p><strong>5. Finish with a light hold hairspray.</strong> To keep your curls in place, finish with a light hold hairspray.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Medium Length Hair for Long Faces</h2><p>Now that you know how to style your medium length hair, let's talk about how to maintain it. Here are some tips to keep your hair looking healthy and beautiful:</p><p><strong>1. Get regular trims.</strong> To keep your hair looking its best, it's important to get regular trims. This will help to prevent split ends and keep your hair looking healthy.</p><p><strong>2. Use a deep conditioning treatment.</strong> Once a week, use a deep conditioning treatment to keep your hair moisturized and healthy.</p><p><strong>3. Avoid over-styling.</strong> While it's tempting to style your hair every day, try to avoid over-styling. This can cause damage and make your hair look dull and lifeless.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about medium length hair for long faces:</p><p><strong>Q: Can I wear my hair straight?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely! While curls can help to create volume and movement, straight hair can also be flattering on a long face shape.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I have thin hair?</strong></p><p>A: If you have thin hair, you may want to consider adding layers to your haircut. Layers can help to create the illusion of thickness and volume.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I wash my hair?</strong></p><p>A: How often you wash your hair depends on your hair type and personal preference. Some people may need to wash their hair every day, while others can go a few days between washes.</p><h2>Hair Care Products for Medium Length Hair for Long Faces</h2><p>Here are some recommended hair care products for medium length hair for long faces:</p><p><strong>1. Heat Protectant: </strong>Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Perfector Straightening Mist</p><p><strong>2. Hairspray: </strong>TRESemmé Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray</p><p><strong>3. Deep Conditioner: </strong>SheaMoisture Manuka Honey &amp; Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Protein Power Treatment</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Medium length hair is a great choice for those with long face shapes. With the right haircut and styling techniques, you can create a flattering and balanced look that showcases your beautiful features. Remember to maintain your hair with regular trims and deep conditioning treatments, and avoid over-styling to keep your hair looking healthy and beautiful.</p></article>
