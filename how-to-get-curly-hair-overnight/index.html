Here are some methods to try: <h3>Using a Curling Iron</h3> If you have a curling iron, you can use it to create curls quickly. Here's how: 1. Start with freshly washed and dried hair. Apply a heat protectant spray to your hair before using the curling iron. 2. Heat up your curling iron to the desired temperature. 3. Divide your hair into sections and clip them up. 4. Take a small section of hair and wrap it around the curling iron, holding it in place for about 10 seconds. 5. Release the curl and move on to the next section of hair. 6. After you've curled all of your hair, apply a light hold hairspray to set the curls. <h3>Using Rollers</h3> Rollers are a great way to get curls without using heat. Here's how to use them: 1. Start with damp hair. Apply a styling product to help hold the curls. 2. Divide your hair into sections and roll each section onto a roller, starting at the ends and rolling up to your scalp. 3. Secure the rollers in place with clips or pins. 4. Leave the rollers in overnight. 5. In the morning, remove the rollers and gently tousle your hair with your fingers to break up the curls. 6. Apply a light hold hairspray to set the curls. <h3>Using Braids</h3> Braids are another way to get curls without using heat. Here's how: 1. Start with damp hair. Apply a styling product to help hold the curls. 2. Divide your hair into sections and braid each section tightly. 3. Secure the ends of the braids with small elastics. 4. Leave the braids in overnight. 5. In the morning, carefully unravel the braids and gently tousle your hair with your fingers to break up the curls. 6. Apply a light hold hairspray to set the curls. <h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h2> To get curly hair overnight, follow these steps: 1.
