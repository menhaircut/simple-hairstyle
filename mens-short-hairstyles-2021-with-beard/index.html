In this article, we'll be discussing the top mens short hairstyles 2021 with beard. From the classic buzz cut to the trendy fade, we've got you covered. Plus, we'll provide tips on how to maintain your new look and answer some frequently asked questions. Let's get started!</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Short Hairstyle with Beard</h2><p>Before we dive into specific hairstyles, it's important to consider your face shape and hair type. A style that looks great on someone else may not work for you. Here are some general guidelines:</p><h3>Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a round face, you may want to choose a style that adds height and length. A square face looks great with angular cuts that accentuate the jawline. Oval faces can pull off almost any style, while long faces benefit from shorter cuts that balance out the length.</p><h3>Hair Type</h3><p>Thick, coarse hair works well with short, textured cuts, while thin hair benefits from volume-adding layers. If you have curly hair, you may want to opt for a cut that leaves some length on top to showcase your natural texture. Straight hair can handle sharp, clean cuts.</p><h2>Top Mens Short Hairstyles 2021 with Beard</h2><p>Now that you have an idea of what might work for you, let's dive into some specific styles.</p><h3>The Buzz Cut</h3><p>The buzz cut is a classic style that will never go out of fashion. It's low maintenance and looks great with a beard. Plus, it's perfect if you're experiencing hair loss or thinning.</p><p>To achieve this look, ask your barber to use clippers with a short guard. The length can vary depending on your preference, but a #2 or #3 guard is common. You can leave some length on top for styling or keep it short all around.</p><h3>The Crew Cut</h3><p>The crew cut is another timeless style that's great for men with short hair. It's similar to the buzz cut, but with a bit more length on top. You can style it with a side part, slicked back, or messy texture.</p><p>Ask your barber to use clippers with a #4 or #5 guard on the sides and back, tapering down to a #2 or #3 guard at the hairline. The top can be left longer, around 2-3 inches, or shorter if you prefer.</p><h3>The High and Tight</h3><p>The high and tight is a military-inspired cut that's perfect for men with a square or angular face shape. It's short on the sides and back, with a longer strip of hair on top that's styled forward or up.</p><p>To achieve this look, ask your barber to use clippers with a #1 or #2 guard on the sides and back, fading up to a longer strip on top. You can style it with a matte pomade or wax for a textured finish.</p><h3>The French Crop</h3><p>The French crop is a trendy style that's especially popular in 2021. It's a short cut with a textured fringe on top that's styled forward. It looks great with a full beard or a neatly trimmed goatee.</p><p>To get this look, ask your barber to cut the sides and back short with clippers, leaving around 2 inches on top. The fringe can be styled with a texturizing product like sea salt spray or a matte pomade.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Short Hairstyle with Beard</h2><p>Now that you've chosen your new look, it's important to keep it looking sharp. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Visit your barber every 4-6 weeks for a trim.</li><li>Invest in quality hair products that work for your hair type.</li><li>Use a beard oil or balm to keep your facial hair soft and manageable.</li><li>Wash your hair and beard regularly, but don't overdo it as this can strip natural oils.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I pull off a short hairstyle with a beard?</h3><p>Short hair and a beard look great on most men, but it's important to consider your face shape and hair type. A good barber can help you choose a style that works for you.</p><h3>How do I style my short hair with a beard?</h3><p>It depends on the style you choose, but generally, you can use a matte pomade, wax, or sea salt spray to add texture and hold. Your barber can recommend products that work for your hair and beard.</p><h3>Do I need to trim my beard as often as my hair?</h3><p>It depends on how fast your beard grows and how neat you want it to look. As a general rule, you should trim your beard every 2-4 weeks to keep it looking tidy.</p><h2>Hair Care for Mens Short Hairstyles 2021 with Beard</h2><p>Short hair and a beard are low maintenance, but that doesn't mean you can neglect them. Here are some hair care tips:</p><ul><li>Use a shampoo and conditioner that's appropriate for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like flat irons or curling irons, as they can damage your hair.</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh down your hair.</li><li>Protect your hair and scalp from the sun by wearing a hat or using a leave-in conditioner with SPF.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this guide has helped you choose your new short hairstyle with beard. Remember, it's important to consider your face shape and hair type when choosing a style. Don't be afraid to experiment with different products and styling techniques to find what works for you. And most importantly, enjoy your new look!</p></article>
