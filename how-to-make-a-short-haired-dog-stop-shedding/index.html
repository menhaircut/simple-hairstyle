Short haired dogs can shed just as much as long haired dogs, and it can be difficult to keep up with the amount of hair they leave behind. However, there are steps you can take to make a short haired dog stop shedding. In this article, we will provide you with a how-to guide on how to reduce shedding in your short haired dog.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short haired dogs can shed just as much as long haired dogs, leaving hair all over your furniture, carpets, and clothes. Shedding is a natural process for dogs, but excessive shedding can be a sign of an underlying health issue. Reducing shedding in your short haired dog not only keeps your home clean, but it can also improve your dog's health.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>To make a short haired dog stop shedding, you need to take a few steps to maintain their coat and overall health. These include:</p><h3>1. Brush your dog regularly</h3><p>Brushing your dog regularly removes loose hair and prevents it from ending up all over your home. Use a brush that is appropriate for your dog's coat type, and brush in the direction of hair growth. Make sure to brush your dog gently to avoid irritating their skin.</p><h3>2. Feed your dog a healthy diet</h3><p>A healthy diet can improve your dog's coat and reduce shedding. Make sure your dog is getting enough protein, vitamins, and minerals in their diet. Avoid feeding your dog table scraps or low-quality dog food that can cause skin irritation and excessive shedding.</p><h3>3.

Talk to your vet about which supplements are right for your dog.</p><h3>4. Bathe your dog regularly</h3><p>Bathing your dog regularly removes loose hair and dirt that can contribute to shedding. Use a dog-specific shampoo that is gentle on your dog's skin, and avoid over-bathing your dog as it can dry out their skin and cause more shedding.</p><h3>5. Keep your dog hydrated</h3><p>Adequate hydration is essential for a healthy coat and skin. Make sure your dog always has access to clean water, and add wet food or broth to their diet to increase their fluid intake.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>To make a short haired dog stop shedding, follow these steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Brush your dog regularly</h3><p>Use a brush appropriate for your dog's coat type and brush in the direction of hair growth.
