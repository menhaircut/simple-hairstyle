It is a natural response to a challenging situation that can trigger a range of physical and emotional responses. One of the most common physical responses to stress is hair fall. Stress can cause hair to fall out in clumps, thinning of hair, and even bald patches. Hair fall due to stress is often temporary, and the hair growth cycle will resume once the stress is relieved.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Stop Hair Fall Caused by Stress</h2><p>The first step in stopping hair fall caused by stress is to identify the underlying cause of stress. Once you have identified the cause, you can take steps to manage your stress levels. Here are some ways to stop hair fall caused by stress:</p><h3>1.
