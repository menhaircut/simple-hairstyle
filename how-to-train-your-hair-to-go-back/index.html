By following these steps, you'll be able to achieve a sleek and sophisticated hairstyle that is both practical and stylish.</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>The first step in training your hair to go back is to start with clean hair. Wash your hair with a mild shampoo and conditioner to remove any dirt, oil, or product buildup. This will make it easier to style your hair and will also help to prevent breakage.</p><h3>Step 2: Use a Comb</h3><p>Using a comb, gently comb your hair back in the direction that you want it to go. Start from the front and work your way back, making sure to comb your hair in a smooth and even motion. Be sure to use a comb with wide teeth to avoid damaging your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Product</h3><p>Apply a small amount of styling product, such as gel or pomade, to your hair. This will help to hold your hair in place and will also give it a sleek and polished look. Be sure to use a product that is appropriate for your hair type and texture.</p><h3>Step 4: Repeat Daily</h3><p>Repeat this process daily, combing your hair back in the same direction each time.
