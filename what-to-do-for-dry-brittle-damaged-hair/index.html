Aim to trim your hair every six to eight weeks.</p><h2>Tips for Hair Care and Maintenance</h2><p>Here are some tips for hair care and maintenance:</p><h3>Tip 1: Use a Wide-Tooth Comb</h3><p>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair instead of a brush. Combs are gentler on your hair and less likely to cause breakage.</p><h3>Tip 2: Don't Overwash Your Hair</h3><p>Don't overwash your hair as it can strip your hair of its natural oils. Aim to wash your hair every two to three days.</p><h3>Tip 3: Protect Your Hair from the Sun</h3><p>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a hair sunscreen spray. The sun's UV rays can damage your hair and make it more brittle.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can I Repair My Dry Brittle Damaged Hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can repair your dry brittle damaged hair.
