<meta name="description" content="Pin on Short Haircuts For Men If you&#39;re looking for a classic hairstyle that&#39;s easy to maintain and looks great on just about anyone, a flat top might be just what you need. And luckily, it&#39;s a style that&#39;s easy to achieve with just a pair of clippers and a bit of know-how. In this guide, we&#39;ll show you how to cut a flat top with clippers, step by step.  What You&#39;ll Need  Before you get started, you&#39;ll need to gather a few things: - A pair of clippers with a flat top comb attachment - A handheld mirror or a wall-mounted mirror - Hair scissors - A spray bottle filled with water - Styling gel or pomade (optional)  Step-by-Step Guide  Now that you have everything you need, it&#39;s time to start cutting your flat top. Follow these steps:  Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair  Start by washing your hair thoroughly and letting it air dry. You want your hair to be clean and free of any products, so avoid using any styling products before you start.  Step 2: Choose Your Clipper Guard Size  Choose the clipper guard size you want to use for your flat top. A size 2 or 3 guard is a good starting point if you have medium-length hair, but feel free to adjust based on your preferences and hair length.  Step 3: Start Cutting  Attach the flat top comb attachment to your clippers and turn them on. Starting at the back of your head, run the clippers over your hair with the comb attachment flat against your head. Move the clippers in an upward motion, against the direction of your hair growth. Repeat this process until you&#39;ve cut all of the hair on the back and sides of your head.  Step 4: Blend the Top  Now it&#39;s time to blend the top of your hair with the sides. Using your clippers, run them over the top of your head, but this time, use a smaller clipper guard size, such as a size 1 or 2. Move the clippers in an upward motion, blending the hair on the top of your head with the sides.  Step 5: Cut the Top  Using your scissors, cut the hair on the top of your head to the desired length. You can use a handheld mirror or a wall-mounted mirror to help you see the top of your head and make sure you&#39;re cutting it evenly.  Step 6: Style Your Hair  Once you&#39;ve cut your hair to the desired length, you can style it using gel or pomade. Apply a small amount to your hands and work it through your hair, shaping it into a classic flat top.  Tips for Cutting a Flat Top  - Start with a longer clipper guard size and work your way down if needed. - Take your time when cutting the top of your hair to ensure it&#39;s even. - Use a handheld or wall-mounted mirror to help you see the back of your head. - Don&#39;t be afraid to ask for help if you&#39;re not comfortable cutting your own hair.  FAQs  Q: How long does a flat top haircut last? A: A flat top haircut can last anywhere from 2-4 weeks, depending on how fast your hair grows. Q: Can I cut a flat top with scissors? A: While it&#39;s possible to cut a flat top with scissors, it&#39;s much easier and more precise to use clippers with a flat top comb attachment. Q: How do I maintain my flat top haircut? A: To maintain your flat top, you&#39;ll need to trim it every few weeks and use styling products to keep it in shape.  Hair Care  To keep your hair looking its best, be sure to wash it regularly and use a conditioner to keep it soft and hydrated. Avoid using too many styling products, as they can build up on your hair and make it look greasy. And don&#39;t forget to trim your hair regularly to keep it looking neat and tidy. .">
